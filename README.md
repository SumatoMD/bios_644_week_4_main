Here is my submission for week 4's assessment for BIOS640. 

The files to be evaluated for the assessment are in the folder **week_4_assessment_for_evaluation**.

The files used from Week 3 contain the changes suggested in the feedback, including the expressed code.
I realize that missing answers to question from assessment 3 were laid out in-line with the code, that did not render in the final product. 

That oversight has been rectified for this exercise, as well as retroactively (although I know my grade cannot be changed). 

The references for the bibliography in exercise #4 are located in the file nhanes_references.bib.

Thank you for the continued constructive feedback, I hope the quality of code is improving!
