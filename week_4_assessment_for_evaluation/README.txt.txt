Here are the submissions for assessment. Exercise 2 is in the HTML document titled "week_4_assessment", due to my issues with exercise 4 I was reluctant to change the file name at the last minute. Exercise 4 is truncated due to errors in the code that occurred at the last minute which I was not able to rectify. Unfortunately I was not able to find all of the source material to meet the needs of the assessment in the course material, and the online resources led me down an overcomplicated road that I could not recover from.
